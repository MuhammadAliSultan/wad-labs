            <h2>Things I Dislike About Web Development</h2>
            <img src="1.jpg" alt="disadvantages">
            <p>While web development is an exciting field, there are a few challenges that come with it. Here are some of the downsides I have encountered:</p>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Responsive Design Issues</strong></summary>
                <p>Websites that aren’t optimized for mobile devices can be frustrating for users. It’s essential to ensure that the website looks and works great on all screen sizes.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Internet Connection is Required</strong></summary>
                <p>Unlike desktop software, websites rely heavily on an internet connection to function. This can be limiting when the user doesn't have access to the internet or has a poor connection.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Security Concerns</strong></summary>
                <p>Websites are vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. Ensuring that your website is secure and protects user data is always a top priority for web developers.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Limited Functionality</strong></summary>
                <p>Some websites have limited functionality compared to native desktop applications. For example, a website might not be able to perform certain tasks without external tools or plugins.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><strong>Compatibility Issues</strong></summary>
                <p>Different browsers and devices render websites in slightly different ways, leading to potential compatibility issues. This means developers have to test and optimize for multiple platforms.</p>
            </details>
